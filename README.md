# Linkify2

This plugin adds links to other pads by wrapping the pad name in [[*name*]].

That is to say, any text in a pad that is surrounded by double square brackets will become a link to a pad with the name as the text between the brackets.  This makes Etherpad much more wiki-like.

This is essentially a copy of the original ep_linkify, which has been abandoned for years.

Tested by author with etherpad 2.2.6 on 2024-11-07.
